    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>At KLV Express Delivery, we believe that every delivery can make a difference. Founded by husband-and-wife team Kevin and Victoria Richardson, our mission is to provide fast, reliable, and compassionate medical supply courier services when it matters most. Together, we bring more than 30 years of combined experience in customer service, leadership, and logistics. Victoria has spent two decades building trusted relationships through exceptional service, including ten years in management and four years in dispatch management. Kevin brings a decade of leadership experience rooted in teamwork, accountability, and care for the community. Our journey is deeply personal. After losing loved ones who faced delays in receiving critical medical needs, we realized how vital timely delivery can be. We couldn’t make a difference then — but we’re determined to make one now. That commitment drives everything we do at KLV Express Delivery. As a family-owned and operated business, we pride ourselves on delivering not just packages, but peace of mind. We are HIPAA-compliant, available 24/7, and dedicated to ensuring that every delivery is handled with urgency, accuracy, and compassion. At KLV Express Delivery, we don’t just move supplies — we move care forward.</p>
